        <h1>What is minimal fitness?</h1>
        <p class="about-p">
            Minimal fitness is not a fad of some sorts. It's not an unrealistic training routine. It's not a over-complicated fitness concept.
            Minimal fitness is what you need when you need it. It strips away all the complication from todays over-saturated fitness industry,
            and provides you with the percise knowledge that you need in order to excel in your fitness journey. Whether you're a complete beginner, or
            you have already taken your first steps on your fitness journey, these bits of information will propel you forwards.
           
            There are 3 main elements to the minimal approach. <strong> Diet</strong>, <strong> Training</strong> and <strong>Rest</strong>. That's it! That's all it 
            takes in order to see good results.
       </p>
        <p class="about-p">
            However, as mentioned before, the fitness industry is over saturated with informtion. Therefore I'm 
            going to break these core elements down into simple, easy to follow chunks of information that will start you off on the right path. 
            Fitness shouldn't be complicated. As long as you put in the work and stay consistant and approach fitness minimally you will get maximum 
            results.

            <p>My name is Max, and I have had the pleasure to work in the fitness industry for over 5 years. I'm qualified a
                personal trainer and sports therpist. Over the years my clients have seen incredible transformations, in their
                physique and lifestyles. And each and every client I worked with, I have always had the same approach. A good
                structured workout routine. A solid diet that hits client specific nurtitional goals. A healthy approach to rest and 
                rest days.

                    <p>Diet is where the majority of confusion stems from. There are too many conflicting ways in which people approach this.
                        They either go for the 'keto' approach or 'low-carbs' or 'carb-cycling'. But what do all of these diets have in common?
                        The answer is reduction of calories. As long as you burn more calories than you consume, you will lose weight.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        And vice versa, if you want to gain weight you must consume over your maintainance calories. 
                        But How do you know how many calories you need in order to cut or gain weight?
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        The answer is simple. We find our calories utilising a <strong>BMR</strong> (basal metabolic rate)
                        calculator (which you can find <a href="https://www.inchcalculator.com/mifflin-st-jeor-calculator/" target="_blank">here</a>)This helps determine the calories you need to maintain your current weight without the 
                        inclusion of any exercise. Once your basal clories have been determined we will then apply your <em>
                        activity multipliers</em>, these range from:
                        <br>
                        <ul class="am-ul">
                            <li>1.2 <em>(sedentary)</em></li>
                            <li>1.375<em>(lightly active)</em></li>
                            <li>1.55<em>(moderatly active)</em></li>
                            <li>1.725 <em>(very active)</em></li>
                            <li>1.9<em>(extremely active)</em></li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Once you have this calculated. Your final calorie number is what you need to maintain your weight. Then
                        it's a matter of either, adding calories in order to slowly gain weight, or subtract in order to lose weight.
                        Remember, if you decide to gain weight, do it in a slow controlled manner. If you cut down on weight, do it slowly
                        in order to hold onto muscle mass while effectivley burning fat.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Finally, the most important aspect to tieing your diet together is understanding you <em>macros</em>. Macros or
                        macronutrients are comprised of <strong>Protien</strong>, <strong>Carbohydrates</strong> and <strong>Fats</strong>. 
                        I reccomend tracking these three macros regardless of your goals to cut or bulk. For more information regarding macronutrients,
                        you can find them <a href="https://avitahealth.org/health-library/macronutrients-a-simple-guide-to-macros/">here</a>.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        If you plan to lose fat and get leaner you should focus on having a higher diet in protein, as protein helps muscle 
                        recovery and keeps you satiated for longer along with helping your body hold onto muscle 
                        (studies can be found <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/10-reasons-to-eat-more-protein">here</a>).
