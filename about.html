        <h1>What is minimal fitness?</h1>
        <p class="about-p">
            Minimal fitness is not a fad of some sorts. It's not an unrealistic training routine. It's not a over-complicated fitness concept.
            Minimal fitness is what you need when you need it. It strips away all the complication from todays over-saturated fitness industry,
            and provides you with the percise knowledge that you need in order to excel in your fitness journey. Whether you're a complete beginner, or
            you have already taken your first steps on your fitness journey, these bits of information will propel you forwards.
           
            There are 3 main elements to the minimal approach. <strong> Diet</strong>, <strong> Training</strong> and <strong>Rest</strong>. That's it! That's all it 
            takes in order to see good results.
       </p>
        <p class="about-p">
            However, as mentioned before, the fitness industry is over saturated with informtion. Therefore I'm 
            going to break these core elements down into simple, easy to follow chunks of information that will start you off on the right path. 
            Fitness shouldn't be complicated. As long as you put in the work and stay consistant and approach fitness minimally you will get maximum 
            results.

            <p>My name is Max, and I have had the pleasure to work in the fitness industry for over 5 years. I'm qualified a
                personal trainer and sports therpist. Over the years my clients have seen incredible transformations, in their
                physique and lifestyles. And each and every client I worked with, I have always had the same approach. A good
                structured workout routine. A solid diet that hits client specific nurtitional goals. A healthy approach to rest and 
                rest days.

                        the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer 
                        took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic 
                        typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages,
