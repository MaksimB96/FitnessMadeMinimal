        <h1>What is minimal fitness?</h1>
        <p class="about-p">
            Minimal fitness is not a fad of some sorts. It's not an unrealistic training routine. It's not a over-complicated fitness concept.
            Minimal fitness is what you need when you need it. It strips away all the complication from todays over-saturated fitness industry,
            and provides you with the percise knowledge that you need in order to excel in your fitness journey. Whether you're a complete beginner, or
            you have already taken your first steps on your fitness journey, these bits of information will propel you forwards.
           
            There are 3 main elements to the minimal approach. <strong> Diet</strong>, <strong> Training</strong> and <strong>Rest</strong>. That's it! That's all it 
            takes in order to see good results.
       </p>
        <p class="about-p">
            However, as mentioned before, the fitness industry is over saturated with informtion. Therefore I'm 
            going to break these core elements down into simple, easy to follow chunks of information that will start you off on the right path. 
            Fitness shouldn't be complicated. As long as you put in the work and stay consistant and approach fitness minimally you will get maximum 
            results.

                    <p>Diet is where the majority of confusion stems from. There are too many conflicting ways in which people approach this.
                        They either go for the 'keto' approach or 'low-carbs' or 'carb-cycling'. But what do all of these diets have in common?
                        The answer is reduction of calories. As long as you burn more calories than you consume, you will lose weight.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        And vice versa, if you want to gain weight you must consume over your maintainance calories. 
                        But How do you know how many calories you need in order to cut or gain weight?
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        The answer is simple. We find our calories utilising a <strong>BMR</strong> (basal metabolic rate)
                        calculator (which you can find <a href="https://www.inchcalculator.com/mifflin-st-jeor-calculator/" target="_blank">here</a>)This helps determine the calories you need to maintain your current weight without the 
                        inclusion of any exercise. Once your basal clories have been determined we will then apply your <em>
                        activity multipliers</em>, these range from:
                        <br>
                        <ul class="am-ul">
                            <li>1.2 <em>(sedentary)</em></li>
                            <li>1.375<em>(lightly active)</em></li>
                            <li>1.55<em>(moderatly active)</em></li>
                            <li>1.725 <em>(very active)</em></li>
                            <li>1.9<em>(extremely active)</em></li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Once you have this calculated. Your final calorie number is what you need to maintain your weight. Then
                        it's a matter of either, adding calories in order to slowly gain weight, or subtract in order to lose weight.
                        Remember, if you decide to gain weight, do it in a slow controlled manner. If you cut down on weight, do it slowly
                        in order to hold onto muscle mass while effectivley burning fat.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Finally, the most important aspect to tieing your diet together is understanding you <em>macros</em>. Macros or
                        macronutrients are comprised of <strong>Protien</strong>, <strong>Carbohydrates</strong> and <strong>Fats</strong>. 
                        I reccomend tracking these three macros regardless of your goals to cut or bulk. For more information regarding macronutrients,
                        you can find them <a href="https://avitahealth.org/health-library/macronutrients-a-simple-guide-to-macros/" target="_blank">here</a>.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        If you plan to lose fat and get leaner you should focus on having a higher diet in protein, as protein helps muscle 
                        recovery and keeps you satiated for longer along with helping your body hold onto muscle 
                        (studies can be found <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/10-reasons-to-eat-more-protein" target="_blank">here</a>). However,
                        if you plan to gain weight, your focus should be on your carb sources. Additional information on properly bulking may be
                        found <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/bulking#basics" target="_blank">here</a>

                        Training should not be over complicated. In fact, bellow you may find a great resource from 'Jeff Nippard'. Explaining That
                        having a minimal approach to training, can produce the same amount of progress as individuals who spend hours in the gym! If 
                        you are a complete beginner I reccomend full body splits as you strengthen your body fully and build technique which will over time
                        help you move more weight!

                        Not only this but training is highly beneficial in reducing stress and supporting your immune system.
                        If you run or walk, your cardio and pulmonary systems increase, which meanss you take in more oxygen.
                        more oxygen means you can train longeer and harder nd supply your body with nutrients more effectivley.
                        Resistance training not only strengthens your joints, ligmaments, increases muscle mass and density but 
                        also stimulates your lymphatic system which eessentially means a higher immunity! For the benefits of
                        exercise go <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1402378/" target="_blank">here</a>!

                    <div class="content">
                        <p>Finally we have rest! This is by far the most overlooked aspect of training. The majority of people
                            tend to get tunnel visioned when it comes to diet and training more, which is not necessarily bad,
                            but they miss the third aspect of fitness.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Rest is essential for muscle growth and recovery. You must know that when you train, you create 
                            'micro-tears' in your muscle fibres. When you consume good quality food, it provises your body 
                            with the components to heal the micro-tears. This is how muscle growth works. But you only benefit 
                            from this when you rest. When you sleep your body naturally spends this time replinishing hormone levels
                            rebuilding and healing. The better the quality of your rest, the better you heal! For in-depth information
                            on how sleep is essential to your body you may find it <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6281147/" target="_blank">here</a>
                            by David F. Dinges, PhD.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Finally, rest also includes reducing the amount of stress you experience, which ties back into diet and 
                            training. If you have a well balanced diet, your immune system will be strong and you will feel better in 
                            general. If you train well, you help releive stress thrrough the natural endorphine release you get. Even just
                            staying active through running or walking benefits your body massivley. It is reccomended that on average you sshould 
                            aim for 7-8 hours sleep!
